Let suppose I chose the Rust language: 

## 1
There are build-in tools in the Rust development package to linting, testing and building.
But also there are some great tools, such as:
- For linting: "clippy_lints".
- For testing: "static_assertions".
- For building: "cc".

## 2
Alternative tools:
- Jenkins: CircleCI, TeamCity, Ansible
- GitHub Action: GitLab CI, Azure Pipelines

## 3
This setup is better to be in cloud-based environment, because number of developers in team are a few and for this team cloud-based environment is cost effective.
